## Notes

The SQLite database used in this project is a lightweight, open-source relational database management system. It is embedded in the application and provides a local data storage solution for the app. The database consists of tables that store data in rows and columns, and it uses SQL (Structured Query Language) to manage the data. In this project, the database is used to store and retrieve nutritional information, such as calories and  type of food that the user enters into the app. The database schema defines the structure of the tables and the relationships between them, and the app uses DAO (Data Access Object) classes to interact with the database. The database is accessed and modified asynchronously using Kotlin coroutines to prevent blocking the UI thread.
